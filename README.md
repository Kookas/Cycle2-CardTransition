# Card Transition for Cycle 2 (scrollCards)

This transition is a lot like sliding one playing card over another: as the top card slides in, the card underneath is pushed out of the way, due to friction between the bottom of the top card and the top of the bottom card.

# Installation

Include the .js file in your website and then set this attribute on your Cycle2 element: <code>data-cycle-fx="scrollCards"</code>.

# Customisation

By default, the bottom card will move 500px, but this can be customised using the rather lengthy "data-cycle-cards-shift-out" attribute.
