# Card Transition for Cycle 2

This transition is a lot like sliding one playing card over another: as the top card slides in, the card underneath will be pushed out of the way slightly.

In other words, the current background will slide out a small distance as the next one slides in. This is intended to be a subtle effect; it is akin to the transitions of the Android app drawer as found in versions 4.0 - 4.4.
